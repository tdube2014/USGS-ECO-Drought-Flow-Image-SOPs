## **Introduction** <a name="introduction"></a>
The goals of this project are to 1) find a new way of measuring how much water flows in small stream networks using timelapse images captured by inexpensive and off-the-shelf cameras and 2) provide a web-based platform for making the images, associated climate and other related data as well as the model itself easy to access and explore. This project will represent a major advancement in how we measure the flow of water by using machine learning (a form of AI) capable of recognizing and reproducing patterns in large and complex datasets such as long-term image timelapses coupled with detailed environmental data. The results of this work will have considerable value for tracking changes in small streams, which are very important habitat for plants and animals. Stream flow is one of the most important environmental drivers in stream habitats, but we don’t currently have a good way to measure stream flow in small stream networks. This is especially important now as small streams are increasingly affected by climate change via more frequent intense floods and more loss of connectivity due to droughts, in addition to challenges introduced by increasing stream temperatures. A better understanding of flow changes and patterns in small streams will help us evaluate which streams are the most likely to be climate refugia and are the best candidates for management and policies to protect vital aquatic habitats otherwise at risk due to warming and drying.

### **Equipment List** <a name="subparagraph1"></a>



<br>
We have attached a list of supplies as a starting point, most are theequipment we use. Actulal items will vaty depending on the camera you choose. The catagories will likely stay the same. As long as you haver a clear view of the river the images should be useful.

### Trail Cameras <a name="subparagraph2"></a>

+ Trail Cameras that support EXFI data embedded images, this is criticle (most game camera images do). This becomes an issue if you manipulate the files after download, for example, converting the files to another file type or rotating the images. The exchangeable image file format (EXIF) is a standard for embedding technical metadata in image files that many camera manufacturers use and many image-processing programs support. EXIF metadata can be embedded in TIFF and JPEG images.
+ No resolution requirement. As long as you can see if the stage is high, medium or low, the images are useful 
+ Sd card, blue tooth, WIFI and cellualar models avaliable.
+ Price from $99 to $599
+ Camera manufacturers
  - **Bushnell** This is the camera manufacturer that we use. There are alot of excellent cameras on the market.
  - Moultrie
  - Stealth Cam
  - Many more

### Camera mounts <a name="subparagraph21"></a>
There are a variety of way to mount cameras, tree straps, tree screws, Fence T posts and stand alone ground mounts to name a few.

+ Tree Strap

#### Methods

+ Any size river is useful.
+ Establish a location for digital flow collection.
+ Install camera so that you can record clear digital photos of the river In a upstream Direction.

* we are currently working on images from diferent angles to see what provides the best data*

+ Collect digital Photos. images must have EXIF data embedded (most game camera images do. This becomes an issue if you manipulate the files after download, for example, converting the files to another file type or rotating the images.
+ flow and image data at any timestep is useful. Data increments ranging from 15-minute to weekly are especially useful (longer than weekly is helpful is it is a long term record of condition.
+ No resolution requirement. As long as you can see if the stage is high, medium or low, the images are useful.
+ Record and check the time zone and daylight savings settings on the game camera at deployment. Most game cameras DO NOT adjust for daylight savings time.
+ Download images and insure that the camera is returned to the same location (angle and line of sight of stream).
+ label images?
+ Upload to?

USGS Flow Cam Discharge Data collection


#### Methods

## USGS ECODrought Non Gage Station Images ##

+ Establish a location for for digital flow pictures. 
+ Install camera so that you can record clear digital photos of the stream in a upstream direction.
+ Note the angle and line of site of the camera to ensure that it is repositioned to the aproprite placement after maintenance or data download.
+ Set camera to record data every 15 min on the hour and set to standard time.
+ Download the camera the begining of each month.
+ + Record and check camera settings. Recored battery level. Note any onformation on camera or conditions that may be usefull when QAQC of dat is being performed.
+ label images?
+ Upload to?
+ +Generate a stage discharge rating curve

##  USGS ECODrought Gage Station Images ##

+ Install camera so that you can record clear digital photos of gauge pool including control in a upstream direction. If possiable have photos capture satff gauge height as well.
+ Single camera setup. All Setups except Avery Brook.
